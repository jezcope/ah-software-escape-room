# How to contribute?

:+1::tada: First of all, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

You can make this project better by contributing to it. You can report mistakes
and errors, create more content, etc. Whatever is your background, there is a
way to contribute: via the GitHub website, via command-line or even without
dealing with GitHub.

We will address your issues and/or assess your change proposal as promptly as we
can, and help you become a member of our community.

## How can I report mistakes or errors?

The easiest way to start contributing is to [open an issue](https://github.com/jezcope/ah-software-escape-room/issues/new) to tell
us about a problem such as a typo, spelling mistake, or a factual error. You can
then introduce yourself and meet some of our community members.

## How can I get started with contributing?

This repository store the sources for the website.
You can help us improve it and get acknowledged for your contributions.

Here are a few ways you can get started with contributing to this program.

1. Help us address one of the [issues currently open in our repository](https://github.com/lostRSEs/escape-room/issues).
2. [Create a new issue](https://github.com/lostRSEs/escape-room/issues/new) to suggest changes/improvements on our website/program.
3. Send a pull request to correct typo, or fill any gap that you see on our website.

## How can I contribute in "advanced" mode?

To manage changes, we use
[GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) based on Pull
Requests:

1. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) of this
   repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork of this repository to create a local copy on your computer
3. Create a new branch in your local copy for each significant change
4. Commit the changes in that branch
5. Push that branch to your fork on GitHub
6. Submit a pull request from that branch to the master repository
7. If you receive feedback, make changes in your local clone and push them to
   your branch on GitHub: the pull request will update automatically
8. Pull requests will be merged by the training team members after at least one
   other person has reviewed the Pull request and approved it.

## What can I do to help the project?

In issues, you will find lists of issues to fix and features to implement. Feel
free to work on them!
